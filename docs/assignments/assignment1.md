# Assignment 1

## Interview Report


Participant 1 is a 20-year-old university student in Guatemala majoring in Data Science. The social platform he uses most is TikTok, where he primarily watches videos from international models, influencers, dermatologists, data scientists, and mainstream celebrities. One of his most memorable moments on the platform was a controversy involving rapper Ice Spice. What made this moment stand out was how different users explained the issue and shared their opinions, sparking discussions in the comments. This allowed him to learn from diverse perspectives. However, he doesn’t comment or share his views due to a fear of criticism and concerns about ending up on the wrong side of the community. He appreciates TikTok's algorithm but sometimes feels it lacks personalized content, offering mostly local videos. In terms of design, he finds the platform cluttered and believes that some tools, like filters and feeds, are unnecessary. Reflecting on memories, he mentioned writing reflective posts about his daily life accompanied by pictures on Instagram. What stood out to me was his mention of having a second Instagram account used solely to share personal experiences with his closest friends. He revisits memories through Instagram’s stories archive and stays updated on others by watching and uploading stories.

Participant 2 is a 26-year-old private sector development consultant from Guatemala, currently living in London. He primarily uses Twitter to stay updated on economic affairs, technology, and financial research, and to follow global and local news, including pop culture topics that may not be widely covered. He mainly follows scholars, journalists, and people who engage in discussions, appreciating the platform's discussion threads and the inclusion of article screenshots. He also enjoys the quick response of people towards big occurrences he brought up the number of posts he saw about Trump when he got COVID and the various responses there were. However, he finds the amount of misinformation, incorrect fact-checking, and the presence of bots and inappropriate content frustrating. He noted the different ways people use Twitter in Guatemala, sharing that some have met through the platform, and mentioned he once learned through Twitter that a friend had moved to London, although he doesn’t follow many in-person friends. For keeping up with friends’ life changes, he prefers LinkedIn or Facebook, particularly when people post about relocating or looking for housing. While he used to store memories on Facebook, he no longer enjoys the platform and now just documents personal moments in Photos he enjoys the through-back videos created by the Apple Photo app. He used to use a physical journal or the Notes app when traveling alone to document his experience and look back on it. 

## Design Opportunities to Explore
- Explore a feature that uses location data to help friends stay updated on each other’s whereabouts. This could notify friends when someone travels to a new city or moves a significant distance, enabling easier meetups. Users might appreciate the convenience of spontaneous get-togethers, making this feature valuable for maintaining connections. A corresponding design could allow users to manually update their location or have it change automatically after a certain period.

- Develop a journaling platform where users can document their memories with pictures and text, creating personal entries. Users could collaborate on entries with friends, adding anecdotes and reflecting on shared experiences. Revisiting these entries could help people remember specific events, fostering emotional connections and self-reflection. This feature would enhance emotional engagement and personal expression.

- Design a social media feed that separates content into two sections: one for general exploration and another focused solely on updates from friends. This would allow users to discover new content or influencers while maintaining a close connection to their friends’ activities. The design could cater to users interested in both lifestyle influencers and their personal networks, balancing broader exploration with deeper personal connections.
